Q6. What are constructors in Java?

*******************************************************************************/
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}

While creating an object we need the constructor.
i.e. constructors initializes (create) the object of class.
Class a = new Class();
class name must match with constructor.
it has no return type.
when the class loads, constructor loads first.

2 Types :

Default constructor : 
    it is called by default if no constructor is provided.
    it has no parameters.
    Its used to initialize instance members with default(0) values.
    As we know it is used to create the object.

Parameterized constructor :
    the constructor which takes arguments.
